# PRIVATE REPO
--------------
# php-watermark
PHP script to watermark JPEG,GIF and PNG pictures.
Also you might use it as PHP/GD-lib benchmark tool.
- For example:
-- my Hezner test server result is ~8.5 seconds. For benchmarking and test there are some private Sony-A77 pictures added into repository. Excuse me for such a huge data =) Best wishes!
-- my Intel Xeon 5320 (4 cores, 8 Gb) do this script with current file setup in ~40 seconds on Win7 + PHP 5.6

## USAGE:
<p>
-- clone this git <br>
-- copy your images (script allows directories tree) in "in" dir<br>
-- start PHP CLI script:<br>
<br>
		#server> php wm.php  <br>
<br>
-- wait until done<br>
-- get watermarked files in "out" dir<br>
-- PROFIT!<br>
</p>
